# app-deconfliction

The competing-apps subdirectory contains the Fiscal Year 2023 App Deconfliction Prototype that uses hardwired file-based simulation data with pluggable deconfliction methodology classes.

The service subdirectory contains the Fiscal Year 2024 Centralized Deconfliction Service that uses GridLAB-D simulations with a combined deconfliction methodology applied in three stages: Rules & Heuristics, Cooperation, and Optimization.

Each subdirectory contains a README.md file describing the purpose, contents, and how to run the capability.
